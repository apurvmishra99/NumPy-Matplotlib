# NumPy-Matplotlib
Jupyter notebook containing a tutorial on how to use NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Requirements
Python 3 is required to run this. (n/b: Python 3.8 seems to break Jupyter Notebook at the moment.)

## How to run
### If you do have Jupyter Notebook
Note: If you are using this method, make sure you also have NumPy and Matplotlib installed in your system.
Run `jupyter notebook` and find the notebook in the directory where you cloned it to.

### If you don't have Jupyter Notebook
First check if you have pipenv installed. If not, run `pip3 install pipenv`.

Once you cloned this repo, go to it on your terminal and run `pipenv shell`.

Once that is done, run `jupyter notebook`.

This will then open your browser, and then you'll be able to open the notebook.
