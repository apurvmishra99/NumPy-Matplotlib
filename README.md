# NumPy-Matplotlib
Jupyter notebook containing a tutorial on how to use NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Requirements
Python 3 is required to run this. (n/b: Python 3.8 for Windows seems to break Jupyter Notebook at the moment.)
If you don't have Jupyter notebook, Numpy, and Matplotlib, you can easily get it by typing `pip3 install notebook numpy matplotlib`.

## How to run
Run `jupyter notebook` and find the notebook in the directory where you cloned it to.
